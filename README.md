## Problem Statement I

```
Write a function that takes in an array of at least three integers and,
without sorting the input array, returns a sorted array of the three largest
integers in the input array. The function should return duplicate integers if necessary; 
```


> Sample input : [10, 5, 9, 10, 12]

> output : [10, 10, 12]
    
    
## Problem Statement II

```
Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum.
The function should find all quadruplets in the array that sum up to the target sum and return a two-dimensional
array of all these quadruplets in no particular order. If no four numbers sum up to the target sum, the function 
should return an empty array.
```
> Sample input : 
array = [7, 6, 4, -1, 1, 2] 
targetSum = 16

>Sample output:
[[7, 6, 4, -1], [7, 6, 1, 2]] // the quadruplets could be ordered differently


## Problem Statement III

```
Write a function that takes in a big string and an array of small strings, all of which are smaller in length than the big string.
The function should return an array of booleans, where each boolean represents whether the small string at that index in the array 
of small strings is contained in the big string. Note that you can't use language-built-in string-matching methods.
```

>Sample Input:
bigString = "this is a big string" 
smallStrings = ["this", "yo", "is", "a", "bigger", "string", "kappa"]

>Sample Output: [true, false, true, true, false, true, false]

## Problem Statement IV

```
Write a function that takes in a string of lowercase English-alphabet letters and returns the index of the string's first 
non-repeating character. The first non-repeating character is the first character in a string that occurs only once. 
If the input string doesn't have any non-repeating characters, your function should return -1.
```

>sample input : string = "abcdcaf"

>output :The first non-repeating character is "b" and is found at index 1.
